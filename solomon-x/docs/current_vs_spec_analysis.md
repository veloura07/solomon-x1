# Current Project vs. Solomon X Specification Analysis

## Current Project Structure (project-solomon)

### Backend (Python)
- Electron main process spawns Python WebSocket server (brain.py)
- WebSocket server handles authentication and message routing
- Ring-based system with 10 predefined AI personalities/archetypes
- Each ring has specific model, temperature, top_p, top_k, and system prompt
- Conversation history stored per-ring with trimming mechanism
- Uses Ollama for LLM inference (qwen2.5:1.5b model)
- Simple message streaming via WebSocket

### Frontend (Electron/Three.js)
- Frameless Electron window with Three.js visualization
- Ring-based UI orbit system
- Warp transition system for invoking chat interface (Ars Almadel ring)
- Basic token streaming UI in invocation space
- Hardware-accelerated rendering

## Solomon X Specification Requirements

### 1. Global Runtime Topology & Core Invariants
- Cross-OS execution split (Windows presentation shell vs Linux compute engine via WSL2)
- Layer 0 Goal Firewall with cryptographic single-use initialization token
- Three-tier permission system (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Doubt Engine with Epistemic Disbelief Index calculation
- Cognitive Rollback mechanism

### 2. Cognitive Data Substrate
- 9-Horizon Memory Cortex with different storage infrastructures per horizon
- Lorentzian Reality Graph & Goal Gravity Mechanics (pseudo-Riemannian manifold)
- Knowledge Translation & Dream Engine Batch Pipelines
- Memory Reputation Score calculation

### 3. Orchestration Layer: Agent Senate & Cognitive Resource Economy
- 9 specialized agents (Guardian Core, Architect Engine, Engineer Specialist, etc.)
- Cognitive Resource Economy (CRE) Utility Scoring
- Dynamic Ingestion Token Pools & Agent Passports
- Self-Healing Loops (Meta-Solomon Daemon, Agent Evolution Lab, Automated Red Team)
- Morning Brief Panel

### 4. Multimodal Perception & Interaction Fabric
- Co-Equal Input Matrix & Intent Fusion Layer (gaze, cursor, typing, history)
- Perception Airlock & Micro-Gesture Language (MGL)
- Scientific Cognitive State Tracker (Focus Index, Cognitive Load, Mental Momentum)
- Hardware-Level Sensor Status Light Invariants

### 5. Tool Execution Fabric & Core Workflows
- End-to-End Unified Execution Trace
- Technical Integration Maps (IDE, Terminal, GitHub, Web)
- DuckDB Temporal Audit Ledger & Rollback Execution
- Human Sovereignty Gate Event Loop (Mentor Mode Challenge)

## Gap Analysis

### What Exists (Foundation to Build Upon)
✅ Electron/Three.js frontend with visualization
✅ WebSocket-based client-server architecture
✅ Ring-based AI personality system
✅ Basic conversation history management
✅ Ollama integration for LLM inference

✅ Authentication token system

### What's Missing (To Be Implemented)
❌ Cross-OS execution split (currently all in one process)
❌ Layer 0 Goal Firewall and permission tiers
❌ Doubt Engine and Epistemic Verification Calculus
❌ 9-Horizon Memory Cortex (only basic conversation history exists)
❌ Lorentzian Reality Graph & Goal Gravity Mechanics
❌ Knowledge Translation & Dream Engine pipelines
❌ Agent Senate with 9 specialized agents
❌ Cognitive Resource Economy utility scoring
❌ Dynamic Token Pools & Agent Passports
❌ Self-Healing Loops (Meta-Solomon, Agent Evolution Lab)
❌ Multimodal Perception & Input Fusion
❌ Scientific Cognitive State Tracker
❌ Hardware sensor indicators
❌ Tool Execution Fabric with sandboxing
❌ Technical Integration Maps (IDE, Terminal, GitHub, Web)
❌ DuckDB Temporal Audit Ledger
❌ Human Sovereignty Gate (Mentor Mode Challenge)

### Key Architectural Shifts Needed
1. **From Monolithic Backend to Layered Architecture**: Split presentation (Windows) from compute (WSL2/Linux)
2. **From Simple Ring System to Agent Senate**: Replace rings with specialized agents that collaborate
3. **From Basic History to 9-Horizon Memory**: Implement sophisticated multi-tier memory system
4. **From Direct LLM Calls to Orchestrated Workflows**: Implement CRE-based agent bidding and execution
5. **From Static UI to Multimodal Perception**: Add gaze, gesture, and biometric input processing
6. **From Simple Streaming to Auditable Workflows**: Add temporal ledger and rollback capabilities
7. **From Basic Security to Constitutional Core**: Implement Layer 0 firewall and human sovereignty gate

## Innovation Opportunities
1. **Unified Perception-Action Loop**: Integrate multimodal input with agent orchestration
2. **Emergent Memory Organization**: Use Lorentzian geometry for self-organizing knowledge
3. **Adaptive Agent Specialization**: Allow agents to evolve specialties based on usage patterns
4. **Predictive Cognitive Offloading**: Anticipate user needs before explicit requests
5. **Quantum-Inspired Uncertainty Modeling**: Use quantum probability concepts in doubt engine
6. **Holographic Memory Principles**: Apply holographic storage concepts to memory horizons
7. **Autonomous Constitutional Evolution**: Allow the Layer 0 firewall to evolve via verified consensus
